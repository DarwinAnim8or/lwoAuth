lwoAuth, a simple test server for the ALPHA version of LU.
This project is not related to; and is not DLU.
That said; anyone is welcome to work on this project.


I'm not taking this project as seriously as I take DLU -- this is just a side thing :P
(This is mostly just for fun and because I loved alpha LU)

This server has RakNet 3.25 included and can be compiled with Visual Studio 2017.

Please note that this server is just for fun and should not be used to host a server for more than a few people!
